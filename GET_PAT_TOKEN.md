### Step 2: Create or Copy Your Personal Access Token
```
1. Look for "Personal Access Tokens" section
2. If no token exists:
   - Click "Generate New Token"
   - Name it: "Claude Code - Phase 1.2"
   - Click "Generate"
3. Copy the token (it looks like this):

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- ✅ **Safe to share with Claude:** I'll only use it for this session
- ✅ **Limited scope:** Only creates API keys for your project
- ⚠️ **Keep it private:** Don't share in public repos/chat
- 🔄 **Can revoke anytime:** Delete token from Supabase if needed
